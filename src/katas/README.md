# Kata

This contains katas in different languages.  Convention is to have the
exercises in paths under the convention of:
```
//src/katas/<language>/<exercise>
```

When I redo the exercise, I delete and replace the code in the appropriate
folder and if I want to look back, I use git history to see a particular
version.
