# My code monorepo

This is my code monorepo.  I don't have a lot of code, but I want to have it
all in a single repository, so that I can reuse tooling.  I also want to use
`bazel`.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. Install the build/env dependencies:
  1. `cargo`
  2. `direnv`
  3. `g++`
3. Run bootstrap:
```sh
$ direnv allow
$ bootstrap.sh
```

## Initial setup notes

1. Initial bazel setup
```
$ touch WORKSPACE
$ touch BUILD.bazel
$ bazel build ...
# configure .gitignore
```
2. Setup [gazelle](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle) and run:
```
$ bazel build ...
$ bazel run //:gazelle
```
3. Setup `direnv` and `gazelle` shell script
```
$ sudo apt-get install direnv
$ cat <<EOF >> ~/.zshrc
export DIRENV_LOG_FORMAT=
eval "\$(direnv hook zsh)"
EOF
$ direnv allow
$ gazelle
```
4. Setup a CI check to test that `gazelle` does not need to be run.
5. Add `bazel buildifier` and add it to the CI script.
6. Add shellcheck. Note, my setup only works on linux, but adding Mac would not be too difficult.
7. Pin buildifier to a particular tag.
8. Add bazelisk in order to not need a system `bazel` installation.
9. Add github actions to bootstrap bazelisk and run the ci script
10. Install `cargo-raze` via `cargo install` and then setup `Cargo.toml`.
  FIXME sometime later in order to have something similar to `gazelle` setup for `cargo-raze`.
11. run `cargo raze` from the `cargo` repository.
12. Manually create a `BUILD.bazel` file for a rust binary/library.

## Known issues

There is a list of known issues, that I would like to address before I deem this to be working perfectly:
* `rules_go` does not provide an IDE integration for generated files. `gopls`
  works pretty well for source code and jumping to definition for standard
  library or dependencies used via go modules though.
  Tracked in https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/issues/512
* `cargo-raze` does not work well with the IDE. There have been a few
  improvements that may be used to make this better, but I have not made it to
  work yet. Related links:
  * https://github.com/google/cargo-raze/issues/42
  * https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/development/languages/rust/editors
  * https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_rust/issues/71
  * https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_rust/pull/384
  
  It is possible to get autocompletion working if one symlinks //cargo/{target,Cargo.{toml,lock}} files to the library directory and moves the `.rs` files into a `src` subdir.
