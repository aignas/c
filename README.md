# My code monorepo

This is my code monorepo.  I don't have a lot of code, but I want to have it
all in a single repository, so that I can reuse tooling.  I also want to use
`bazel`.

## Setup notes

Initial setup
```
$ touch WORKSPACE
$ touch BUILD.bazel
$ bazel build ...
# configure .gitignore
```
